# SEPA
Codes to use terrarium sensors for SEPA 2021



Install Arduino IDE before proceeding with the following directions.



For temperature sensor: 

1. Go to sketch -> Include libraries -> Manage libraries... and add OneWire and DallasTemperature. 
2. Then, from Include libraries those two contributed libraries
3. Click the check mark at the top of the IDE to compile
4. Plug the Arduino into laptop USB sensor
5. Click the rightward arrow (which uploads the program to the Arduino to run). You may need to select the port (it should be the USB port)

To view the output, click the magnifying glass icon in the upper righthand corner. It will display a serial monitor



For light sensor: 

1. Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage libraries... and add Adafruit_TSL2591. 
2. Go to Sketch -> rom Include libraries those two contributed libraries
3. Click the check mark at the top of the IDE to compile
4. Plug the Arduino into laptop USB sensor
5. Click the rightward arrow (which uploads the program to the Arduino to run). You may need to select the port (it should be the USB port)

To view the output, click the magnifying glass icon in the upper righthand corner. It will display a serial monitor
